        <p class="editable">
            <strong><br />A psychological, authentic and profound encounter with another human being can change our lives and transform the world within us. It can inspire and calm us to accept ourselves as we are now and to walk authentically toward what we can become.<br /><br />We can work on a type of therapeutic process:<br /><br />Structured - focused on a specific problem with an approximation of time on solving / improving / reducing its negative effects.&nbsp;<br />In this approach we work with specific measurable objectives nuanced by you, on issues separated in their psychological and practical components.<br /><br />Non-structured free self-exploring this style of work is best described by the following metaphor:<br /><br />When Christopher Columbus left Spain in 1492 with his small fleet of 3 ships on a discovery mission, he wanted to discover a new route to India for the Spanish crown:&nbsp;<br /><br />&ldquo;During his voyage at sea, there were times when the wind it was pounding, and the little ships were advancing well. But there were times when the wind stopped completely and the water became calm, with the surface smooth as a large mirror and the vessels drifting and seemingly endless, frozen by equatorial calm for weeks on end&hellip;&nbsp;<br /><br />And there were periods of thunder and lightning, with winds that brought torrents of rain and huge waves threatening ships and crew.&nbsp;<br /><br />Therapy experience is reflected in all stages described. Columbus had gone on a journey to discover a new road to India, but he discovered a new world instead! &rdquo; (Evans, 2013)<br /><br /><br />Integrative group psychotherapy<br /><br />An increasingly common affliction today is that those deep and sincere discussions about the deepest insecurities we feel, or the deepest and most vivid parts of us, we only talk about them a few times throughout our lives. Or sometimes not at all for decades and decades in a row.<br /><br />The deepest and most vivid parts of us will only see the light of day for a few moments in our whole life, and the witnesses of these moments will be less than the fingers of one hand.<br /><br />Group psychotherapy proposes an organized and confidential framework for these deep and authentic discussions about who we are as human beings and what we want to become in a social setting, along with other people who are on the same path.</strong>

        </h4>
        <p class="editable">
            <strong><br />Philosophical counseling is aimed at people who want to deepen their way of being (in the words of the rapper Mos Def) through which they feel strong, not aggressive, free not only licensed, full of compassion not only polite, good not only well mannered.<br /><br />Philosophical counseling provides us with an environment through which we can investigate and analyze with empathy our own experiences of being human. Its focus is on the attitudes, assumptions, ideas, belief systems, and values with which we approach life to extract insights on how to live our lives better and more authentically.<br /><br />Our joint effort in counseling will be in order to create an existence invested by you with meaning and significance, congruence and authenticity that you enjoy.</strong>

        <p class="editable">
            <strong><br />Psychological counseling &amp; individual and group personal development<br /><br />After almost 150 years of psychotherapy, we are full of recipes on how to be productive, efficient, happy, fulfilled, but the necessary ingredients have remained the same -&nbsp; the nature of man and the human condition reflected in his particularity.<br /><br />If you had a happy childhood, there is not so much pressure on the second half of life to feel the good and delightful side of the human experience.<br /><br />But if the first part of life has been sprinkled with suffering, adversity, deprivation, abuse, trauma, isolation, alcohol, drugs, violence, poverty, hunger, shame, anxiety, anger, depression, eating disorders - the second part of life is a chance to live, but especially to feel the good and beautiful part of life.<br /><br />The second part of life is perhaps your last chance to heal, to repair, to make peace with the past, to move towards a future in which you feel an ounce of calm, of serenity, of peace, and joyful acceptance of the world within you and a bit of care to the world outside of you.<br /><br />The wounded parts of us only need new sources of trust towards life and in ourselves, new ways of calming our inner waves, and empathic warmth for what it means to be a humane human.&nbsp;<br /><br />The wounded parts of us crave new sources of hope and meaning to extract the courage we need, to go out in the world and live what we need to live.<br />A suffering mind is always looking for new ways to anesthetize the pain, but a relational mind is always looking for new ways to connect and deepen its contact with life.</strong>

            <strong>Art gives us the chance to remember past moments, to hope for the best, to be resilient with suffering, to rebalance, to understand ourselves, to grow, but especially to appreciate the beauty of life and to be comforted from the painful chaos in it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Art therapy means that we will use the art practiced by you or preferred by you as a way of exploring self-knowledge, reflection and self-development through creative means supported by psychotherapeutic processes.<br /><br />Also here I have included the cinema-therapy, which at this time is probably the most popular form of therapy on the planet. We will work on existential movies with which you have a special connection and we will use them as ways for personal development.<br /><br />Bibliotherapy is another popular form of therapy and includes the use and analysis of books as the main means for your personal development.</strong>

        <p class="editable">
            <strong>Written psychotherapy is a relatively old form of therapy (poets and writers) but new in the set of psychotherapeutic practices.<br /><br />The forms of this psychotherapy are multiple, from working with a journal to record states, memories, dreams, desires, and then using the journal in psychotherapy, to writing therapeutic topics for personal development, or an entire process of psychotherapy exclusively through writing using an application.<br /><br />Writing has become one of the main psychotherapeutic means available to people. Its usefulness and importance in increasing psychological well-being are given by its accessibility and daily use in our lives. Everyone writes tones of messages and emails every day, why not try psychotherapy in writing too?</strong>
