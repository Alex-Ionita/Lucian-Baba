                When life is hard, we need to change. When we suffer we need to transform. Suffering never left us as it found us. Its effect on man is either to fragment or to transform him, but it never leaves us the same as it found us.<br /><br />Exactly in this moment of transition, psychotherapy and counseling offer their unique value, accompanying man among the highest and lowest moments of his existence, giving him an opportunity for reflection, deepening the way he understands his life, changing himself, and his environment, and transforming himself.<br /><br />Hi! I am Lucian and I am an integrative psychotherapist, a philosophical counselor passionate about accompanying people in this process. My expertise is focused on the processes of change and transformation of people, and my professional efforts are dedicated to healing human suffering and creating together a new way of being in which authenticity, receptivity, and vulnerability are not impediments, but resources in the service of humanizing yourself and the life you will live.
