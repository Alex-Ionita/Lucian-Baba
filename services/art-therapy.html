            <strong>Art gives us the chance to remember past moments, to hope for the best, to be resilient with suffering, to rebalance, to understand ourselves, to grow, but especially to appreciate the beauty of life and to be comforted from the painful chaos in it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Art-therapy means that we will use the art practiced by you or preferred by you as a way of exploring self-knowledge, reflection and self-development through creative means supported by psychotherapeutic processes.<br /><br />Also here I have included the cinema-therapy, which at this time is probably the most popular form of therapy on the planet. We will work on existential movies with which you have a special connection and we will use them as ways for personal development.<br /><br />Bibliotherapy is another popular form of therapy and includes the use and analysis of books as the main means for your personal development.</strong>
