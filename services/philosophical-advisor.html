            Philosophical counseling
        </h3>
        <p class="editable">
            Philosophical counseling is aimed at people who want to deepen their way of being (in the words of the rapper Mos Def) through which they feel strong, not aggressive, free not only licensed, full of compassion not only polite, good not only well mannered.<br /><br />
            Philosophical counseling provides us with an environment through which we can investigate and analyze with empathy our own experiences of being human. Its focus is on the attitudes, assumptions, ideas, belief systems, and values with which we approach life to extract insights on how to live our lives better and more authentically.<br /><br />
            Our joint effort in counseling will be in order to build an existence invested by you with meaning and significance, congruence and authenticity that you enjoy.<br /><br />
