            Psychosexology
        </h3>
        <p class="editable">
            Psychosexology is the field that deals with the psychological study of sexuality, especially the mental representations and manifestations of sexuality as each individual experiences it.<br /><br />
            During psychotherapy, the therapist together with the client will learn the adaptive and maladaptive meanings of his sexual behavior and how the quality of experiencing love (received and offered, physically, emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually) can be improved and cultivated.<br /><br />
            Psychosexology deals with the following issues:<br /><br />
            <ul>
                <li>body and sexuality (body image, body schema) gender identity, gender role, and sexual orientation</li>
                <li>asexuality</li>
                <li>sexual behavior across life cycles</li>
                <li>traumatic experiences and risky sexual behaviors</li>
                <li>intimacy and sexuality</li>
                <li>psychological factors that negatively influence the quality of sexual life</li>
                <li>blockages in the phases of sexual intercourse</li>
                <li>sexual/psychosexual dysfunctions (sexual desire/arousal disorder, premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation, orgasmic disorder, substance or medication-induced sexual dysfunction)</li>
                <li>human development and sexuality</li>
                <li>the experience of love</li>
                <li>erotic partnership</li>
                <li>experiencing the state of being in love and types of being in love, the ability to be in love</li>
                <li>the expressions and forms of manifestation of love</li>
                <li>the characteristics of love from an erotic perspective - from the perspective of mature psychosexual behavior</li>
                <li>dysfunctional expressions and beliefs of love and sexual desire taken from family and culture</li>
                <li>family mythologies about partnership, sexuality, marriage, and sex-roles that interfere with the couple's life</li>
                <li>cues and patterns in mate choice</li>
                <li>awareness and knowledge of partner choice modes, implications, and effects</li>
                <li>psychotherapy of LGBTQI+ people in order to increase their quality of life and support their process of identity and becoming</li>
                <li>sexual psychoeducation, sexual psychotherapy, and couples therapy</li>
                <li>mindfulness and psychosexuality</li>
                <li>sexual psychotraumatology (violence/domestic violence and sexual violence)</li>
                <li>addictions and sexual compulsivity, cybersex, pornography</li>
            </ul><br /><br />
            Love is an instinct, an emotion, a conscious capacity as much as a deliberate practice that transcends the boundaries of the ego to bring out the best in us and those around us and nurture our growth, development, and living as human beings.<br /><br />
