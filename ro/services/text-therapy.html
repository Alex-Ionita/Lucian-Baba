            <strong>Psychotherapy through writing</strong>
        </h3>
        <p class="editable">
            <strong>Written psychotherapy is a relatively old form of therapy (poets and writers) but new in the set of psychotherapeutic practices.<br /><br />The forms of this psychotherapy are multiple, from working with a journal to record states, memories, dreams, desires, and then using the journal in psychotherapy, to writing therapeutic topics for personal development, or an entire process of psychotherapy exclusively through writing using an application.<br /><br />Writing has become one of the main psychotherapeutic means available to people. Its usefulness and importance in increasing psychological well-being are given by its accessibility and daily use in our lives.<br /><br />Everyone writes tones of messages and emails every day, why not try psychotherapy in writing too?</strong>
